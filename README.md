CoopCycle
=========

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/coopcycle/coopcycle-web.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/coopcycle/coopcycle-web)

CoopCycle is a **self-hosted** platform to order meals in your neighborhood and get them delivered by bike couriers. The only difference with proprietary platforms as Deliveroo or UberEats is that this software is [reserved to co-ops](#license).

The main idea is to **decentralize** this kind of service and to allow couriers to **own the platform** they are working for.
In each city, couriers are encouraged to organize into co-ops, and to run their very own version of the software.

The software is under active development. If you would like to contribute we will be happy to hear from you! All instructions are [in the Contribute file](CONTRIBUTING.md).

Coopcycle-web is the main repo, containing the web API, the front-end for the website and the dispatch algorithm : [Technical Overview](https://github.com/coopcycle/coopcycle-web/wiki/Technical-Overview). You can see it in action & test it here : https://demo.coopcycle.org

You can find a comprehensive list of our repos here : [Our repos comprehensive list](https://github.com/coopcycle/coopcycle-web/wiki/Our-repos-comprehensive-list).

How to run a local instance
---------------------------

### Prerequisites

Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install).

#### OSX

Use [Docker for Mac](https://www.docker.com/docker-mac) which will provide you both `docker` and `docker-compose`.

#### Windows

Use [Docker for Windows](https://www.docker.com/docker-windows) which will provide you both `docker` and `docker-compose`.
Depending on your platform, Docker could be installed as Native or you have to install Docker toolbox which use VirtualBox instead of Hyper-V causing a lot a differences in implementations.
If you have the luck to have a CPU that supports native Docker you can [share your hard disk as a virtual volume for your appliances](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/stevelasker/2016/06/14/configuring-docker-for-windows-volumes/).

#### Linux

Follow [the instructions for your distribution](https://docs.docker.com/install/). `docker-compose` binary is to be installed independently.
Make sure:
- to install `docker-compose` [following instructions](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) to get the **latest version**.
- to follow the [post-installation steps](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/linux-postinstall/).

#### Setup Google Maps API (optional)

CoopCycle uses the Google Maps API for Geocoding, as well as the Places API.
You will need to create a project in the Google Cloud Platform Console, and
enable the Google Maps API. GCP will give you an API token that you will need
later.  By default, the Geocoding and Places API will not be enabled, so you
need to enable them as well (`Maps API dashboard > APIs > Geocoding API >
Enable`, and `Maps API dashboard > APIs > Places API for Web > Enable`).

### Run the application

#### Start the Docker containers

```
docker-compose up

or if you whant test/dev 

docker-compose up -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.test.yml
```

At this step, the platform should be up & running, but the database is still empty.
To create the schema & initialize the platform with demo data, run:
```sh
make install
```

#### Open the platform in your browser
```
open http://localhost
```

Testing
-------

#### Create the test database

```
docker-compose run php bin/console doctrine:schema:create --env=test
```

#### Launch the PHPUnit tests

```
make phpunit
```

#### Launch the Behat tests

```
make behat
```

#### Launch the Mocha tests

```
make mocha
```

Running migrations
------------------

When pulling change from the remote, the database models may have changed. To apply the changes, you will need to run a database migration.

```
make migrations-migrate
```
