# There are two ways to load the 'setup' fixtures:
# 1. using --setup (-s) option: bin/console coopcycle:fixtures:load -s cypress/fixtures/setup.yml
# that will load and PERSIST all the fixtures from setup.yml
# 2. using the `include` directive in the fixtures files
# that will only load the fixtures from setup.yml, but they will NOT be persisted yet
# which might prevent some other fixtures that expect a certain database state from being loaded
# For example, a fixture that creates an On Demand Delivery order expects both On Demand Delivery product
# and taxes to be present in the database
