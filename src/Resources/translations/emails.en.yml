  \ the following instructions:</p>\n<h2>1. Respect social distancing</h2>\n<p>We\
  \ will drop off your order on your doorstep, so you won't have to approach the person\
  \ who comes to deliver. There is also no need to leave a tip.</p>\n<h2>2. Unpack\
  \ your order after receipt</h2>\n<p>The virus can survive on cardboard and plastic\
  \ surfaces for several days. Packaging is therefore a high risk route of transmission\
  \ of the virus.\nWe therefore ask you to <strong>unpack your order and transfer\
  \ the contents to plates</strong>.</p>\n<h2>3. Dispose of the packaging</h2>\n<p>Once\
  \ your order is unpacked, be sure to <strong>dispose of the packaging in a closed\
  \ bin</strong> to avoid inadvertently touching it later.</p>\n<h2>4. Wash your hands!</h2>\n\
  <p>Once you have unpacked your order and discarded the packaging, <strong>wash your\
  \ hands!</strong></p>\n"
