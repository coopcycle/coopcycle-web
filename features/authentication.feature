  Scenario: Login success
    Given the database is empty
    And the user is loaded:
      | email    | bob@coopcycle.org |
      | username | bob               |
      | password | 123456            |
    When I add "Accept" header equal to "application/ld+json"
    And I send a "POST" request to "/api/login_check" with parameters:
      | key       | value  |
      | _username | bob    |
      | _password | 123456 |
    Then the response status code should be 200
    And the response should be in JSON
    And the JSON should match:
    """
