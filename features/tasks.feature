  Scenario: Retrieve assigned tasks
    Given the fixtures files are loaded:

    And the courier "bob" is loaded:

    And the user "bob" is authenticated
    And the tasks with comments matching "#bob" are assigned to "bob"
    When I add "Content-Type" header equal to "application/ld+json"
    And I add "Accept" header equal to "application/ld+json"
    And the user "bob" sends a "GET" request to "/api/me/tasks/2018-03-02"
    Then the response status code should be 200
    And the response should be in JSON
