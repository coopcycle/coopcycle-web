# Default setup fixtures suitable for most of the tests,
# unless specific customization is needed.
#
# There are two ways to load the 'default setup' fixtures:
#
# 1. (preferred) adding 'setup_default.yml' to the list of files to load (or using the `include` directive in the fixtures files)
# that will only load the fixtures from setup_default.yml, but they will NOT be persisted in the database yet
#
# 2. (advance) using --setup (-s) option: bin/console coopcycle:fixtures:load -s fixtures/ORM/setup_default.yml
# that will load and PERSIST all the fixtures from setup_default.yml
# This is useful when you want to load additional fixtures that expect the 'default setup' fixtures,
# to be already persisted in the database.
# For example, a fixture that creates an On Demand Delivery order expects both On Demand Delivery product
# and taxes to be present in the database
