## [2.9.3] - 2024-06-19

### Fixed

* **Right-click assign in dispatch:** An error in how assignation was working for right-click (was assigning to the first rider of the planning), now fixed.

## [2.9.2] - 2024-06-19

### Changed

* **Support multi points in time based pricing functions:** Now we can use the rules "dropoff/pickup time range length" in pricing rules that are activated for multiple-dropoff orders.

## [2.9.0] - 2024-06-18

### Fixed

* **The ‘Close restaurant for a day’ button closes restaurant for 2 days:** Now when a restaurant uses the "off" button in the CoopCycle app it will only close them until end of that day, reopening the next day automatically
* **A customer can create an order for a disabled (deactivated) restaurant:** Customers could order in a restaurant even though they were closed, but not anymore! (only for web orders for now)
* **Order is created with a preparation scheduled in the past:** We had an issue with incorrect calculations about time ranges for food deliveries that is now fixed. (only for web orders for now)
* **Potential Fix for assignment bug when dispatching on two different tabs on two different days (reported by Naofood):** Since orders can come in for tomorrow, dispatchers had multiple tabs open in food tech. This created problems for the notification system, which we believe we have now fixed.
* **Crash when setting "use avatar color" to Yes:** Just a random crash bug

## [2.8.2] - 2024-06-12

### Changed

- **Allow massively starting tasks:**  Want your last mile provider or local shop to know you have recieved a package or a whole pallet of packages? Right click on multiple tasks now has a "start tasks" option that will inform EDIFACT connected last mile providers that you have correctly recieved these packages, and show an order as started for a shop in their panel.
